/*
    Create a class named Polygon that contains the following information:

    - A constructor method with a parameter to capture information (hint: this should be capturing an array of numbers).
        - assign the parameter to a key using 'this'
    - Has a method named perimeter, that should do the following:
        - return ONLY the parameter, or an empty array from the method
        - call the reduce method on your return value to get a single output value
    

    - Create a new object/instance of the class Polygon that is stored in a variable.
        - The new Polygon should accept an argument that is an array of 4 numbers
    
    - console.log the return value from the newly created Polygon.
