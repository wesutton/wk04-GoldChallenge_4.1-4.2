/*
    - With the given shoppingList array, use array destructuring to assign each array within the shoppingList array its own variable. Then, reinitialize the shoppingList array so it is a single array containing all of the values from the original array. 
    
    - after the shoppingList array has been reinitialized, using the array.prototype.map method, map over the newly initialized shoppingList array. You should do the following within the map method:
        - include a parameter for index
        - utilize the array.prototype.push method to push the current value being mapped over into the appropriate key/value pair in the obj variable
            - you will need to implement some sort of logic to check the index of the current item being mapped over.
